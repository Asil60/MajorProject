# Mastering Reverse Proxies for Web Server Protection

This project explores the implementation and optimization of reverse proxies to enhance web server security, performance, and reliability. Using tools such as **Nginx**, **HAProxy**, and **Traefik**, we aim to build a robust reverse proxy architecture capable of mitigating cyber threats while improving scalability and monitoring.

## Introduction

Web servers are essential for hosting websites, APIs, and applications. They face threats such as **DDoS attacks** and data exfiltration. Reverse proxies serve as intermediaries between clients and backend servers, providing:

- **Enhanced security**: Hiding server identity, filtering malicious traffic.
- **Performance optimization**: Load balancing, caching, and failover mechanisms.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logging and traffic analysis.

---

## Objectives

1. **Understand Reverse Proxy Concepts**:
   - Architecture, features, and real-world use cases.
2. **Enhance Web Server Security**:
   - Implement IP masking, request filtering, and third-party WAF integrations.
3. **Improve Performance and Reliability**:
   - Configure load balancing, caching, and failover mechanisms.
4. **SSL/TLS Termination**:
   - Centralize SSL certificate management and secure communications.
5. **Real-Time Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Analyze traffic metrics and detect anomalies.
6. **Evaluate Effectiveness**:
   - Conduct stress testing, penetration testing, and benchmarking.
